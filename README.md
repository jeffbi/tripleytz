# tripleytz
An implementation of the classic game "Triple Yahtzee".

## Building From Source
`tripleytz` requires the `CMake` build system, the `Qt6` platform, and a C++17 compatible compiler.

### Linux
To build on Linux at the command line, start in the main project directory, create a `build` subdirectory, run `CMake` then run `make`:
```console
$mkdir build
$cd build
build$cmake ..
build$make
```
